# Convolutional Neural Networks with Keras

This repository contains code for building, training, and evaluating Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) using the Keras framework. The project focuses on digit recognition using the MNIST dataset as an example. The repository includes implementations of two CNN architectures and instructions for training and evaluating the models.

## Introduction

This project demonstrates the process of building, training, and evaluating Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) using the Keras library. It includes code examples for loading the MNIST dataset, preprocessing images, building CNN models, and evaluating their accuracy.

## Training and Evaluation
Each script includes sections for loading the MNIST dataset, preprocessing images, building CNN models, training, and evaluating accuracy. Follow the script's instructions to execute these steps.

## Using Streamlit for Interactivity
To make your trained CNN model interactive and user-friendly, you can use Streamlit. Follow these steps to set up and use Streamlit:

Install Streamlit: <br>
pip install streamlit

Run the Streamlit app: <br>
Step 1 ) execute the command "streamlit run app.py" <br>
<br> Step 2 ) Upload an image to the app and interact with the model's predictions.
